# Distributed Denial of Service Attacks
Using GENI to reproduce the results of:
[1] Lau, Felix, et al. "Distributed denial of service attacks." Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 2000 IEEE International Conference on. Vol. 3. IEEE, 2000.

### Introduction ###
Here we reproduce Figures 4 and 5 of Distributed Denial of Service Attacks paper.
The objective of this experiment is to show how effective Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks are under two different queueing schemes: Drop Tail and Random Early Detection.
It shows whether or not legitimate users can obtain desired service while a DDOS attack is in process.
Results are verified using a GENI testbed.

It takes about 30 minutes to reproduce my results.

### Background ###
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is defined as an attempt to make a machine or a resource unavailable to its legitimate users.
When we have more than one source attacing the target, it is called a Distributed DoS (DDoS).
Typically, attackers try to take control of a lot of unique IP addresses (Zombie Machines) and use them to exhaust a resource either on the target machine, or the network that connects legitimate users to the target machine/s.

In this context, it is intersting to see how queueing networks will perform if they are targeted by a DDOS attacks.
Felix Lau et. al tried to find an answer to this question in 2000, and published their results in the paper we cite today.

In their experiment, they have simulated the simplest of DDOS attacks, when a router is targeted by the attacker aiming at overwhelming its queues and authors have analyzed how different queueing management techniques perform under the DDOS attack.
As shown in the figure, a client tries to reach a service through a single hop network with a router connecting it to the server.
Assuming that an attacker takes control of a set of zombie machines connected to the same router, we simulate how he/she can make the service unavailable to the client by targeting the router and overwhelming its queue.
As an outcome, packets will be droped while the attack is in progress and the client will experience a considerable drop in its bandwidth.

The ultimate goal of the router is to forward packets from ligitimate users.
Therefore, the key metric in this experiment is the rate at which client communicates with the server while the attack is in progress.
A rate of zero indicates no connectivity and a rate drop indicates service degradation.

In this project we are interested to reproduce two specific figures from Lau et. al paper.
Figures 4 and 5, which show the performance of the router under DropTail and Random Early Detection (RED) buffer management policies.
Authors of the original paper show that under DropTail attackers can fully deny the client of access to the server, however, under RED, client can still communicate with the server, although at a slower pace and with degraded quality of service.
### Results ###

Figure 5 of [1]:

Verification of results:
For Fig. 4 I was unable to verify that the client receive no bandwidth. Instead, the experiment shows that the client experiences a noticable rate drop:
![tbf.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaghdai/ddos/master/Results/tbf.png)

For Fig. 5 I was can verify the resulta. The experiment shows that the client maintains connectivity under RED even though attackers flood 9Mbps of packets to the router:
![red-client.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaghdai/ddos/master/Results/red_client.png)

Further, I also analysed how sensitive these results are to do change of total attack bandwidth.
Under DropTail queue, attackers can further degrade the client's desired rate by flooding more data:
![result-tbf.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaghdai/ddos/master/Results/result-tbf.png)

Under RED however, increasing total attack bandwidth does not affect the user by a noticable margin:

    <pre><code> $ python draw.py </code></pre></li>
</ol>

### Notes ###
This experiment was done on: Linux 3.13.0-33-generic X86-64, Kentucky InstaGENI

To capture the packets and draw the plots following python packages are requiered:
<ol>
<li> Python 2.7.6 </li>
<li> scapy 2.2.0 </li>
<li> numpy 1.8.2 </li>
<li> matplotlib 1.3.1 </li>
</ol>

Using GENI for verifying the result of [1] is completely doable.
It's pretty easy to get the required resources even through InstaGENI, and modern linux kernels support all the queue management techniqeus used in this paper.

### Troubleshoot ###
<ol>

<li>
If you are not using provided rspec file, please make sure you set the same IP addresses on the client and attacker machines as in the rspec:
  <ol>
    <li>"10.10.1.1": "Client"</li>
    <li>"10.10.2.1": "Attacker 1"</li>
    <li>"10.10.3.1": "Attacker 2"</li>
    <li>"10.10.4.1": "Attacker 3"</li>
    <li>"10.10.5.1": "Attacker 4"</li>
    <li>"10.10.6.1": "Attacker 5"</li>
    <li>"10.10.7.1": "Attacker 6"</li>
    <li>"10.10.8.1": "Attacker 7"</li>
    <li>"10.10.9.1": "Attacker 8"</li>
    <li>"10.10.10.1": "Attacker 9"</li>
    <li>"10.10.11.1": "Attacker 10"</li>
    <li>"10.10.12.1": "Attacker 11"</li>
    <li>"10.10.13.1": "Attacker 12"</li>
  </ol>
</li>

<li> Getting python error complaining about lack of $DISPLAY environment means that you need X forwarding to enable matplotlib plot functions.
On a Linux operating system you just need to pass -X to enable X forwarding:

<pre><code> $ ssh -X [user]@[machine] </code></pre>

To enable X forwarding on Windows/Mac follow these instructions:

[Windows](https://wiki.utdallas.edu/wiki/display/FAQ/X11+Forwarding+using+Xming+and+PuTTY)

[Mac Os](http://dyhr.com/2009/09/05/how-to-enable-x11-forwarding-with-ssh-on-mac-os-x-leopard/)

</li>
<li> Router keeps asking for password in order to connect a1-a12 machines: It means that you need to setup ssh key at router and let it connect to a1-a12 using the given keys. There are two workarounds for this problem:
<ol>
<li> Copy the private key you use for connecting to GENI machines as <pre><code> ~/.ssh/id_rsa </code></pre>
You may need to fix the file permission for the key: <pre><code> chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa </code></pre></li>
<li> Generate a new key for the router using ssh-keygen and copy it to a1-a12 using ssh-copy-id script.
<pre><code> $ ssh-keygen
 $ for i in {1..12};do ssh-copy-id a$i; done</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li> The key used at the router to ssh client machines should not have a passphrase, as it asks for the passphrase every time the router tries to ssh to an attacker. To fully reproduce the results, these scripts try to ssh from router around 400 times, which makes it impossible for you to enter the passphrase every time.
You can either make a new key without a passphrase or remove the passphrase from your ssh key by following this guid:
